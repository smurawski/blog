					<h2>Defining DevOps - NoOps</h2>
					<p>The NoOps guys are these small startups (and not so small startups) where the developer is the guy also doing the operations work and on call. </p>
					<p>There is not a sysadmin in sight.. who needs one, everything runs in the cloud, so we don't need the guys to plug in cables and push the "go faster" buttons...</p>

				<section>
					<h2>Defining DevOps - Traditional IT</h2>
					<p>Traditional IT organizations exhibit the siloing that is typical of large organizations.</p>
					<p>These are the guys who say, "No!" to everything.  The strive for stability, so they don't get paged constantly and can spend some time with the family.</p>
					<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/nerd-fight.jpg"/>
					<p>In traditional IT organizations, there is often very little communication between the developers and operations personnel.  And the communication you see is often like the picture above.</p>
					<p>New software or updated software is often "thrown over the wall" to be deployed at some point.</p>

						<h2>Defining DevOps - DevOps</h2>
						<p>DevOps is a term that was coined by <a href="twitter.com/patrickdebois">Patrick Debois</a></p>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-SysadminDifference.png"/>
						<p>DevOps describes the framework of breaking communications silos and encouraging inter-disciplinary cooperation and integration.</p>
						<p>DevOps acknowledges that problems in software/IT projects is not the responsibility of Devs or IT alone.</p>
						<p><a href="http://itrevolution.com/the-convergence-of-devops/">DevOps can be thought of as the convergence of three specific movements:</a></p>
						<ul>
							<li><small>Agile Infrastructure - Infrastructure as Code (Debois/Shafer)</small></li>
							<li><small>Velocity - Starting with John Allspaw's 10 Deploys a Day</small></li>
							<li><small>Lean Startup - Minimum Viable Product (Ries) and Continuous Delivery (Humble)</small></li>
						</ul>


						<p><a href="http://www.opscode.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/">DevOps is about CAMS - Culture, Automation, Measurement, and Sharing.</a></p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Culture</h2>
						<p>People and process first.  If you don't have culture, all automation attempts will be fruitless.</p>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-Culture.png"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Automation</h2>
						<p>This is one of the places you start once you understand your culture.  At this point, the tools can start to stitch together an automation fabric for Devops.  Tools for release management, provisioning, configuration management, systems integration, monitoring and control, and orchestration become important pieces in building a Devops fabric.</p>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-Automation.png"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Measurement</h2>
						<p>If you can't measure, you can't improve.  A successful Devops implementation will measure everything it can as often as it can... </p>
							<ul>
								<li>performance metrics, </li>
								<li>process metrics,</li>
								<li>and even people metrics.</li>
							</ul>

						<img alt="Forgot this tag" alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-Measure.png"/>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Sharing</h2>
						<p>Sharing is the loopback in the CAMS cycle.  Creating a culture where people share ideas and problems is critical.</p>

						<h2>The Current State of IT</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>IT is responsible for more of the business infrastructure than ever before.</li>
							<li>Deployments today are more perilious then ever.</li>
							<li>The costs of project failure can be staggering.</li>
						</ul>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/gartner-fig-1.jpg"/>
						<p>Even in "low-tech" industries, 95% of all capital projects have an IT component.</p>
						<p>50% of all capital spending is technology related.</p><p>(<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/realgenekim/when-it-fails-the-business-fails">Source - Gene Kim August 20, 2012</a>) </p>

						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Functionality issues</li>
							<li class="fragment">Substantially late</li>
							<li class="fragment">Quality issues</li>
							<li class="fragment">High cost variance</li>

						<h2>The Downward Spiral</h2>
						<h3><a href="http://itrevolution.com/construction-phoenix-project-and-selling-devops-downward-spiral/">Highlights</a></h3>
						<p>In it's current state, IT is stuck in a downward spiral, with problems compounding on each other, making it tougher and tougher to address.</p>
						<p>This situation make each successive project more likely to be the one that collapses the house of cards.</p>
						<p>This spiral includes:</p>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">fragile artifacts become more fragile</li>
							<li class="fragment">technical debt grows</li>
							<li class="fragment">date-driven application projects focus only on features, sacrificing non-functional requirements, which results in more fragile artifacts in production</li>
							<li class="fragment">application deploy take longer, become more turbulent, and continually gets worse</li>
							<li class="fragment">IT Ops is mired in firefighting, and therefore cannot do preventive work or new projects</li>
							<li class="fragment">long feature delivery cycle times result in more political decision making, meaning more focus on features (vs. non-functional requirements</li>
						</ul>

						<small>You may have seen this before...</small>
						</p>
						<p>
							We are uncovering better ways of developing
							software by doing it and helping others do it.
							Through this work we have come to value:
						</p>
						<br />
						<ul>
							<li>Individuals and interactions <b>over</b> <i>processes and tools</i></li>
							<li>Working software <b>over</b> <i>comprehensive documentation</i></li>
							<li>Customer collaboration <b>over</b> <i>contract negotiation</i></li>
							<li>Responding to change <b>over</b> <i>following a plan</i></li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<br />
						<p>
							That is, while there is value in the items on
							the right, we value the items on the left more.
						</p>

					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Individuals and interactions </h2>
						<h2><b>over</b> </h2>
						<h2><i>processes and tools</i></h2>
						<ul>
							<li>What do you deliver to production?</li>
							<li>Do your ops guys know what your dev environment looks like?</li>
							<li>Do ops guys attend your feature planning sessions?</li>
							<li>When have you last talked to an ops guy?</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<br />
						<h4>How are your releases done?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Working software</h2>
						<h2><b>over</b></h2>
						<h2><i>comprehensive documentation</i></h2>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-NagiosCheck.png"/>
						<ul>
							<li>Is software "working" even if features slipped? <small>Like maybe that administration feature.. or that monitoring endpoint?</small></li>
							<li>Do you know how working is defined for the guys maintaining your software?</li>
							<li>Does working mean in your dev environment?  Or in a production like environment?</li>
							<li>Does the definition of "working" match between the stakeholders, developers, and operations personnel?</li>
						</ul>
						<br />
						<br />
						<h4>How do you define working?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Customer collaboration</h2>
						<h2><b>over</b> </h2>
						<h2><i>contract negotiation</i></h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Do you spend more time working on the SLA with IT than with how to ensure meeting the performance requirements of that SLA?</li>
						</ul>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-Performance.png"/>
						<br />
						<br />
						<h4>How do you define customer?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Responding to change</h2>
						<h2><b>over</b> </h2>
						<h2><i>following a plan</i></h2>
						<ul>
							<li>When evaluating your product backlog, are operational considerations discussed based on the results of the current deployments?</li>
						</ul>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-PlanA.png"/>
						<br />
						<br />
						<h4>Are stakeholders/business customers the only drivers of change?</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Is your organization as agile as you thought?</h3>
						<img alt="Forgot this tag" src="./Devops-Images/Borat-AgileTeaching.png"/>
						<p>Agility shouldn't stop after the final commit and build.<p>
						<p>Agility should describe the ability of the <strong>BUSINESS</strong> to respond, not just development.</p>

					<h2>Bringing it back together</h2>
					<p>IT isn't a separate function of a business, it underlays almost every aspect of business today.</p>
					<p>Agile has some great ideas and concepts, but they are too narrowly applied in traditional organizations.</p>
					<p>DevOps strives to bring that same agility across the business. <small>Using the Three Ways, streamlining the flow from Development to Operations, getting feedback back to Development and the business owners, and continually trying to improve infrastructure and offerings, offer a pattern to minimize the downside of failures and get more successes out in the wild.</small></p>
