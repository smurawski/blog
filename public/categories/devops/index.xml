      <description>The Microsoft MVP Summit is coming up again (yes, that&amp;rsquo;s twice this year) and I&amp;rsquo;m getting prepped to head out to Bellevue.
For this trip, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a &amp;ldquo;special offer&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;I&amp;rsquo;ll be giving away 100 copies of &amp;ldquo;The Phoenix Project&amp;rdquo;, thanks to Kevin Behr, Gene Kim, and George Spafford (the authors of the book).
What is &amp;ldquo;The Phoenix Project&amp;rdquo;? Well, a book review deserves a post of its own (and will get it at some point), but the TL;DR; version is &amp;ldquo;The Phoenix Project&amp;rdquo; chronicles the story of Bill, an IT Operations manager in an enterprise setting, as enters into an unwilling journey to finding the principals of DevOps.</description>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;DevOps&amp;rdquo; has been floating around for a few years now. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s gone from relative obscurity to being &amp;ldquo;that thing&amp;rdquo; that organizations need to survive and thrive.&amp;nbsp;
What is DevOps? At it&amp;rsquo;s heart, DevOps is about culture and process. &amp;nbsp;The DevOps mindset draws from manufacturing thinkers like Demming and Goldratt, as well as modern day thought leaders like Allspaw and Humble.
The focus of DevOps culturally is to bring IT in line with the business objectives.</description>
