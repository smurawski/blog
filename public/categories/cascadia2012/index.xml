      <description>I had a great time at the Cascadia conference this past weekend.&amp;#160; I missed Friday, but got to spend all day Saturday teaching PowerShell to a great group of attendees.&amp;#160; There were some great questions and interesting thoughts developed in both the Fundamentals class and the Tips and Tricks class.
I want to thank the organizers of the conference for having me out and especially to the attendees for my classes, most of whom spent all day with me.</description>
