      <description>My friend Microsoft IT Pro Evangelist Brian Lewis (twitter, blog) contacted me about a series he, Matt Hester, Keith Mayer, and Kevin Remde were going to do through the month of October on their favorite things in Server 2012.&amp;#160;
&amp;#160;
My first thought was that a month was not enough, since Server 2012 is chock full of new goodness.&amp;#160; I watched the series develop and added my own meager contribution on what I think is the killer feature in Server 2012 – SMB3 and Continuously Available File Shares.</description>

      <description>I think SMB3 and the enhancements to the clustered file share roles are some of the most important new features in Server 2012.
&amp;#160;
There are some great new features in file shares and the SMB protocol.&amp;#160; Some of the terminology can be confusing, so I’m going to loosely define a few of them right up front.
**SMB3 – **Revised SMB protocol with improved performance, scaling, and support for technology like RSS and RDMA.</description>
