      <description>I’m updating Crystal Reports and trying to determine which reports might have been affected by some schema changes or functional changes in how the data was being stored. The problem I’ve had is that when there are a large number of reports, it is very time consuming to open each one, look at it, and see if it contains any affected tables or views.
I’ve had to deal with this in my previous role as well.</description>
