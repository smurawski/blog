      <description>This morning, Scott Herold and I did back to back presentations on PowerShell and the Virtualization EcoShell for the Wisconsin VMWare Users Group. Time flew by and I didn’t get to the second half of my slide deck, so if you are interested, here it is.
If you want to see the webcast, you can find it here. Just a word of warning, I haven’t listened to it yet, but we were recording over Skype and a fixed microphone while speaking over another mic in a larger room.</description>

      <description>On May 19th, Scott Herold and I will be presenting for the Wisconsin VMWare Users Group. I&amp;rsquo;ll be covering the basics of PowerShell, as well as an introduction to the VI Toolkit (for Windows)/PowerCLI.
Scott will be talking about the Virtualization EcoShell Initiative (VESI).
If you are in Wisconsin, the meeting details can be found here.
If you are not able to make the meeting, VMWare will be providing a live stream of our presentations via WebEx, as well as providing recordings after the fact.</description>
