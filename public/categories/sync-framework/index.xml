      <description>I’ve been exploring the Sync Framework for use in a couple of projects I have going and PowerShell is my preferred exploratory environment.
It was a bit of fun, since I got to work with eventing for the first time in V2.
First, I downloaded the Sync Framework Software Development Kit. That provided me with the Sync Framework runtime as well as some documentation.
The easiest way for me to get started was to take one of the samples and convert that to PowerShell.</description>
