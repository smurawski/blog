## Or Listening To



Reading isn't the easiest way for everyone to learn, so are there any podcasts or lectures or audio books that you are using to further your education?


A few of my favorite podcasts are...


*   [RunAs Radio](http://runasradio.com)
*   [PowerScripting Podcast](http://powershell.org/wp/powerscripting-podcast/)
*   [.NET Rocks!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/)
*   [The Ship Show](http://theshipshow.com/)
*   [DevOps Cafe](http://devopscafe.org/)
*   [Arrested Devops](http://www.arresteddevops.com/)
*   [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/)
*   [Career Tools](https://www.manager-tools.com/podcast/career-tools)

## Or Watching



Maybe audio isn't your preferred medium. &nbsp;Do you have a [PluralSight subscription](http://www.pluralsight.com/training)? &nbsp;Maybe watch videos from the [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) or [Ted Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks)? &nbsp;How about the [DevOpsDays recordings on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/devopsdays)?


## Or Working Through



Do you prefer to get hands on? &nbsp;There are tons of opportunities outside of what you can do in a home lab. &nbsp;You've got the [Technet Virtual Labs](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/virtuallabs/bb467605.aspx)&nbsp;and just about any cloud service has a trial period and running a vm for a short time is pretty cheap once you pass that..

**If you don't know what to do, DO SOMETHING!**




There are free or low cost options in all these spaces. &nbsp;You need to make time to do this stuff if you want to maintain (not even necessarily advance) your career. &nbsp;


**Don't be left behind.**
