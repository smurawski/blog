Well, you are in luck..


I'll be at Techstravaganza in NYC on March 21st talking about the basics of DSC. &nbsp;


I'll be talking about DSC in depth at the [PowerShell Summit at the end of April](http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america/).


Then in early May, I'll be at [LOPSA-East with a half-day class on DSC](http://lopsa-east.org/2014/) and a few other sessions.


And I'm&nbsp;[doing a deep dive into DSC resources at TechMentor in August](http://techmentorevents.com/Events/Redmond-2014/Sessions/Thursday/TH01-Building-DSC-Resources-in-Windows-PowerShell.aspx).
