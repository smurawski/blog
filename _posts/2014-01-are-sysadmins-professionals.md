If so, I'm tired of hearing:


## Source control? &nbsp;That's for developers.



We write and use scripts. &nbsp;Scripts are source code. &nbsp;We need to manage, version, and distribute our scripts. &nbsp;


Source control offers tooling to help with that. &nbsp;Go learn it.


## Programming standards? &nbsp;I don't program, but I only write scripts.



Scripting is programming, just with the connotation that it isn't being done by a professional. &nbsp;It's an excuse for lack of error handling and logging. &nbsp;It's an excuse for sloppy code. &nbsp;


We need to understand the languages we work with, enough to identify code smells (those things that indicate anti-patterns or potential problems). &nbsp;Go read a book about coding standards or [watch some of Uncle Bob's videos.](http://cleancoders.com/)


## Testing? &nbsp;If my script runs, it's working. &nbsp;Besides, I don't have time for that.



So, we've written a script.. but how do we know it works? &nbsp;Will it work when your co-worker Brent tries to run it at 3AM and forgets a required parameter? &nbsp;What happens when you hit an error halfway through?


Testing offers a way to isolate parts of your scripts and verify they do what you think they do. &nbsp;Look at the test frameworks available for the languages you script in. &nbsp;There's even a [unit testing framework for Unix shell scripts](https://code.google.com/p/shunit2/)&nbsp;(which I have no direct experience with, so YMMV). &nbsp;Find a framework and use it.


 


# Let's Step Up Our Game



I'm guilty of the above assertions, but I'm working to change that. &nbsp;Professionalism demands that we do better. &nbsp;We owe it to ourselves, our coworkers, and our employers to do no less.


Oh, and by the way.. **we are responsible for our learning and growth - not our employers** (though the good ones provide ample opportunity for learning).
