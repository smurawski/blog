If you are out on the East Coast and want to pick up some new skills or freshen up some old ones, check out [PICC](http://www.picconf.org/) – the [Professional IT Community Conference](http://www.picconf.org/).



PICC is hosted in New Brunswick, New Jersey and is two days of great SysAdmin content (May 11/12).



### You’ll find half day training sessions on things like:




*   PowerShell (by your truly)
*   Puppet
*   Time Management
*   Technical Resume Writing
*   IPv6
*   Workplace Presentations
*   [and more…](http://www.picconf.org/picc12-training-classes/)


### There are also conference sessions on topics like:




*   Ganeti (Virtualization Management Platform)
*   Windows Deployment with MDT 2010
*   Scaling the StackExchange Platform
*   Configuration Management
*   Securing MySQL
*   Deep Application Monitoring
*   [and more…](http://www.picconf.org/picc-12-talkspapers/)


#### I’ll be there, and I’m definitely going to walk away better prepared to do my job.&#160; 




#### What are you doing to improve your skillset?
