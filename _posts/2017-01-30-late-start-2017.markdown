## Starting off quickly!

My 2017 started off pretty well, with re-award of my Microsoft MVP status in Cloud and Datacenter Management.

That was followed up by a week in Seattle with a few hundred of my fellow Chef employees for our year kick off meeting.

## More Habitat and Rust

I've been working mostly on our [Habitat project](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat) since mid-August.  Habitat is mostly written in Rust and has been a great experience.

## Chef 13 is Coming

For Chef Client, we're moving to a yearly cadence for major releases (with continued minor version bumps every month).  This April will be the release of Chef 13, [which is really exciting times](https://blog.chef.io/2017/01/30/preparing-for-chef-13/)!

## Conferences and Travel

I've got a few conferences and events locked in for this year, and a few that I hope to be at.  The locked in events for this spring are:

#### PowerShell and DevOps Summit - April 9-12 - Bellevue, WA

[This year at the PowerShell Summit](https://eventloom.com/event/home/summit2017), we'll have two rooms where you can get expert feedback or help.

Kirk Munro will be hosting a "Function Lab" and I will be hosting a "DSC Lab".  If you are planning to demo something for the Community Lightning Demos, these labs will be a great resource if you have some last minute questions or want a bit of peer review.

#### ChefConf - May 22-24 - Austin TX

[I'll be running a workshop on Monday, May 22nd on "Making Windows Work For You"](https://chefconf.chef.io/2017/agenda/).

I do have to leave ChefConf early for...

#### IT Transformation / DevIntersection - May 21-24

I'll be speaking [about Continuous Delivery of Infrastructure with Chef and DSC, as well as Application Automation with Habitat](https://devintersection.com/#!/Sharepoint-Office365-Conference/sessions) there.

You can use the discount code "MURAWSKI" and get $50 off registration.
