[@concentrateddon](https://twitter.com/concentrateddon) [@StevenMurawski](https://twitter.com/StevenMurawski) I still find it is sometimes a crap shoot. I prefer to focus on principles and learn to shift quickly.

## So Principals or Trends?

<p dir="ltr">This is a topic that is near and dear to my heart. &nbsp;Having watched the .NET developer community over the past 8 or 10 years evolve to embrace principals like [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)), [core XP practices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), I see parallels with what is occurring in the sysadmin community with the DevOps movement.
<p dir="ltr">When things like SOLID and concepts like pair-programming, unit testing, and continuous integration came into vogue, these concepts flew in the face of traditional practices. &nbsp;Over time, these concepts have proven their worth and many are commonly accepted principals and practices. &nbsp;Before that though, they were embraced by a daring few who recognized their value and evangelized their effectiveness. &nbsp;It is through their efforts that those trends became commonly accepted principals.
<p dir="ltr">We need to use our experience and industry awareness to gauge what trends are worth watching, since today's movements are tomorrows best practice. &nbsp;Look at where the major players are investing. &nbsp;What are the hot startups? &nbsp;Where are conference tracks focused? &nbsp;It isn't easy to divine where the world is headed, but if you want to future-proof your career and have the most options available to you, then you NEED to start paying attention and read the messages in the tea leaves.
<h2 dir="ltr">What Should We (sysadmins) Pay Attention To Now?

<p dir="ltr">I'm going to steal some inspiration from Don and give you my highlights of things to watch and learn....


*   DevOps - Studies are out and the results are in... &nbsp;High performing IT shares some common patterns and these are associated with the DevOps movement. &nbsp;
*   Development tools and methodologies.. &nbsp;Guess what sysadmins, you are developers. &nbsp;Your scripts that run production environments are as important (if not more so) than the application code running on those boxes. &nbsp;Get your heads around source control (and use it). &nbsp;Learn about testing (unit, integration, and acceptance) - let's catch problems before they cause outages.
*   Cloud - Yeah, I hate the term too, but it is real and coming for your job. &nbsp;If you can't offer internal customers the same capabilities (or better), why should your business fund you? &nbsp;We exist to provide business value and if what you do doesn't contribute, MasterCard can buy a service that will.
*   Configuration management (bet you didn't see that one coming) - &nbsp;If you are investing time in the above three concepts, CM tools are a natural fit to advance all three.
*   Cross-platform - homogeneous environments can leave you exposed. &nbsp;Learn the best tools for the job. &nbsp;You don't want to be lost when a critical service moves to run on a Linux based OS.

Ok, those are my top things to watch. &nbsp;What are yours?
