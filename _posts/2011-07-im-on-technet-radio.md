A little while back, I had an <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/john-weston-interviews-steven-murwaski-greater-milwaukee-script-club.aspx" target="_blank">opportunity to talk with John Weston</a> on <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/ff832960.aspx?category=Community Corner" target="_blank">TechNet Radio’s Community Corner</a>.



We talked a bit about PowerShell and the community around it, as well as my local Script Club.
