EDIT :
I have a bunch of scripts that I use regularly, but it can be a pain to type the path.  These are scripts I don't always need, so I don't want to include them in my profile.



I thought it might be convenient to have a way to convert those scripts into functions on demand.   I searched around but couldn’t find an existing script to do that, so here one is. 



<a title="Poshoholic" href="http://poshoholic.com/" target="_blank">Kirk Munro</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/poshoholic" target="_blank">@poshoholic</a>) pointed out that aliases (<a href="http://poshoholic.com/2009/02/04/powershell-quick-tip-create-aliases-to-facilitate-invocation-of-powershell-script-ps1-files/" target="_blank">and expands on it in this blog post</a>) might be an easier way to go.  That would definitely be an option.



Comments and feedback are always appreciated!
