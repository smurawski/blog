## Come Join Us



Well, you could be! &nbsp;If you are a developer with the heart of a sysadmin, we are looking for you to join our Site Reliability Engineering team. &nbsp;[Ship Show Podcast](http://theshipshow.com/2013/08/keep-calm-and-prod-on/)&nbsp; about how to deal with stressful situations in production. &nbsp;That generated some good discussion on Twitter, as well as a great comment from [USENIX LISA](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13) this year. &nbsp;I'll be there teaching a couple of PowerShell classes ([Evil Genius 101 class](https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa13/training-program/full-training-program#T10). &nbsp;And most of the rest of our crew will be there taking in sessions and sharing in the "hallway track".


## And More



Keep your eyes peeled (and watch the&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.serverfault.com" target="_blank">Server Fault Blog</a>&nbsp;for some other details about changes in our infrastructure (cough, cough, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn249912.aspx" target="_blank">DSC</a>, cough, cough).
