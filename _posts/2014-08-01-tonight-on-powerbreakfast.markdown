Yep, you read that right.. Due to the magic of timezones, this **evening (8/1/2014)** at **8:30 PM Eastern**, I'll be giving a talk for the Singapore PowerShell Users Group PowerBreakfast series. &nbsp;This talk will be recorded (see below for details on where to find this talk and previous ones in the series).


## The Talk

<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">***Desired State Configuration in the Real World***
<p style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px">Desired State Configuration (DSC) is getting a lot of attention these days and there are examples abound. In this session, Steven will highlight some of his experiences in getting DSC to scale.&nbsp; We’ll focus on how to separate configuration structure from environmental data, and see what tools are available from the PowerShell.org DSC Community repository to help with this.
<p style="margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px;">And of course, I'm sure the Chef and DSC integration will come up a bit. :) &nbsp;So tune in live via Lync or watch for the recording.
