After a fun weekend of DDOS attacks at work, we've kicked off a flurry of activity to help mitigate the impact for our users.


So, in lieu of a thought-provoking blog post (I've got more on comments coming..), I'm going to share some of my favorite reads.

<p id="yui_3_10_1_1_1392651505263_16333">A must-read for any operations personnel. &nbsp;Covers patterns and anti-patterns for resilient software designed for operations. &nbsp;Though the book is focused for a developer audience, it is ideal for all operations personnel.

Another book targeted for developers, but an excellent resource for scripters. &nbsp;Additionally many of the techniques can be used for generalized troubleshooting.


 


**Enjoy!**
