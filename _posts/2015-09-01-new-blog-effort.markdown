## Blog Migration

I've been running my blog on Squarespace for quite some time and I'm mostly happy with it.  However, I've been writing my posts in Markdown and the code highlighting suppport from Markdown in Squarespace is horrid.

I thought I'd try to move to a Jekyll based blog, with the source in Github and deployed via AppVeyor.

I'm sure there are going to be a lot of posts that need a bit of love, so there are links at the bottom of the page to the source for each post, as well as for the issues page on GitHub.

Hopefully, this will remove some of the impediment to my blogging endeavors (I really didn't want to start new posts on my old blog).
