Richard Campbell was kind enough to have me back on <a href="http://runasradio.com" target="_blank">RunAs Radio</a> to talk about <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=270" target="_blank">SMB3 and Scale-Out File Shares in Windows Server 2012</a>.&#160; We didn’t really talk about anything PowerShell related, but SMB3 and Scale-Out File Shares are a radical topic and are changing my data center deployments in a very good way.&#160; Richard is a super smart guy and always drives the conversation in interesting directions, bringing out points that might have passed by and offering interesting insights that really make you think.



I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, if you aren’t listening to RunAs Radio – start!&#160; It’s a great way to keep abreast of the change and directions the Microsoft IT field is taking.&#160; In recent shows, Richard has covered <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=269" target="_blank">MDT 2012</a>, <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=268" target="_blank">SharePoint</a>, <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=264" target="_blank">boot performance</a>, <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=259" target="_blank">SQL Server 2012</a>, <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=262" target="_blank">Disaster Recovery in the Cloud with VMWare</a>, <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=258" target="_blank">System Center 2012</a>, and the <a href="http://runasradio.com/archives.aspx" target="_blank">list goes on</a>…
