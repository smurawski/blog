This year’s games are in progress, but it’s not too late to start.&#160; Each weekday a new event is posted, but you have a week to turn in your solution, so get out there and start writing some PowerShell.



All the details you need are available from the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/02/04/the-2012-windows-powershell-scripting-games-all-links-on-one-page.aspx" target="_blank">Scripting Games All In One Links Page</a>, where the Scripting Guy Ed Wilson has thoughtfully provided (and updates daily) links to the events, rules, and other great information.



## What Type Of Events Are There?




Well, the first couple of challenges give us an idea..



In the beginner category, you’ll be doing things like:



*   <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/02/the-2012-scripting-games-beginner-event-1-use-windows-powershell-to-identify-a-working-set-of-processes.aspx" target="_blank">Identifying processes</a>
*   <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/03/2012-scripting-games-beginner-event-2-find-stoppable-running-services.aspx" target="_blank">Finding services with particular settings</a>
*   <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/04/2012-scripting-games-beginner-event-3-create-a-file-in-a-folder.aspx" target="_blank">Creating files in folders in the file system</a>


In the advanced category (should you dare..), you’ll find challenges like:



*   <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/02/the-2012-scripting-games-advanced-event-1-review-a-coworker-s-script.aspx" target="_blank">Reviewing someone else’s script</a>
*   <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/03/2012-scripting-games-advanced-event-2-find-information-about-remote-and-local-services.aspx" target="_blank">Working with local and remote services</a>
*   <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/archive/2012/04/04/2012-scripting-games-advanced-event-3-create-a-log-that-updates.aspx" target="_blank">Creating log files</a>


&#160;



## What’s In It For Me?




The Games are a great way to get hands on with PowerShell in a non-destructive manner.&#160; None of the challenges are going to require you to “format c:”.&#160; You also have a chance to win some prizes, so get out there and try them out!
