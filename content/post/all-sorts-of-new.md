A lot has happened since I last had the opportunity to post.&#160; 



Quick recap:



*   <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2009/10/22/tonight-is-the-virtual-launch-party-powerscripting-podcast.aspx" target="_blank">PowerShell v2 is now out</a> and available for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2009/10/27/windows-management-framework-is-here.aspx" target="_blank">XP, Server 2003, Vista, Server 2008,</a> and installed and on by default for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 
*   SharePoint 2010 has an insane number (<a href="http://dmitrysotnikov.wordpress.com/2009/10/19/sharepoint-2010-cmdlet-reference/" target="_blank">492</a>) 
*   There is an <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/CmdletDesigner" target="_blank">open source cmdlet and help designer</a> 
*   <a href="http://trypowershell.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">Try PowerShell</a> is a great way to explore 
*   The <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerShellPack" target="_blank">PowershellPack</a> provides some great modules that get you jump started with V2. 
*   <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/azurecmdlets" target="_blank">Azure has cmdlets for management</a> 
*   There is introductory PowerShell material in the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c48b3eb4-ad4b-461c-9d5a-25f45d949b92&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">Server 2008 R2 Developer Training Kit</a> 
*   <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/learn/courses/WindowsServer2008R2/PowerShell/" target="_blank">There are some PowerShell for Developers training videos on Channel 9</a> 
*   <a href="http://www.jameskovacs.com/blog/ReleasingPsakeV100PsakeV200.aspx" target="_blank">James Kovacs released psake V2.00</a> 
*   <a href="http://pstfs.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">PsTFS has hit V1</a> – which is great for me now.. 
*   I’m sure I’ve missed a ton of other cool <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714418(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank">PowerShell</a> stuff that is happening too.. 


And that leads me to what I’m doing now.&#160; 



In August, I left my job as a IT Specialist for a municipal police department and took a job heading up research and development for <a href="http://www.prophoenix.com" target="_blank">ProPhoenix</a>, which is a software development company that make software for public safety agencies (police, fire, corrections, municipal courts).



I now live in a more software development focused world and will get to spend more time focusing on using PowerShell to automate my current activities, explore new frameworks, and to build a management API for our applications.&#160; I can’t wait to make PowerShell a requirement for our server products installation so I can get our support staff to start leveraging the capabilities PowerShell brings to the table.
