title: Lake County .NET Users Group–Slide Deck and Samples

---

<a href="http://www.scottseely.com/Blog.aspx" target="_blank">Scott Seely</a> and <a href="http://timstall.dotnetdevelopersjournal.com/" target="_blank">Tim Stall</a> invited me to give an introduction to PowerShell talk for the <a href="http://www.lcnug.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Lake County .NET Users Group</a> yesterday evening.



We had a great turnout and a number of good questions.&#160; Thank you to everyone who gave up part of their evening to come and learn a bit about the .NET command shell goodness that is PowerShell.&#160; 



I’ve uploaded the slide deck, sample scripts, and sample Visual Studio solution <a href="http://download.usepowershell.com/IntroToPowerShell-Dev.zip" target="_blank">here</a>.
