title: PowerShell Modules for the SysAdmin

---

Now that I’m back working as a SysAdmin, I’ve come to live in Powershell (even more than I was already)... I regularly have 4 or more console windows open at any one time, plus the ISE.



There are several modules that just make my work much more accessible from the command prompt rather than digging into a GUI or RDP’ing to a server.



ActiveDirectory – The Active Directory module included with the Win7 RSAT or the RSAT on Server 2008 R2



GroupPolicy – The Group Policy module included with the Win7 RSAT or the RSAT on Server 2008 R2



<a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/dnsshell" target="_blank">DNSShell</a> – Module to manage and query DNS from MSDN Code Gallery.



<a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/RepPSAdmin" target="_blank">RepPSAdmin</a> – Active Directory Replication Status module on MSDN Code Gallery



<a href="http://pshyperv.codeplex.com/" target="_blank">HyperV</a> – Module to manage Hyper-V from CodePlex



I use commands from these modules regularly, if not every day.
