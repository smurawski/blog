title: Experimenting with Time Tracking

---

The other week, I started to experiment with a couple of time tracking tools.

## RescueTime

I've used earlier versions of [RecueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) but it never really stuck.  I decided to give it another try and went all in and paid for a year (there is a free tier, but I wanted to give it a long enough run to really build some history and patterns).  It seems to be much more streamlined than when I first tried it.  There's also an Android app to track my phone usage patterns.  There's a browser plugin for Chrome to track the sites you visit as well.  There are a number of other features, but my (initial) use case is pretty standard - I want better awareness of where my days have gone.

RescueTime has been pretty handy in showing me the sites and apps I use and how much of my day is spent on them.  It doesn't give me much more insight than that however.

## Wakatime

The second tool I've started to use is [Wakatime](https://wakatime.com/).  Wakatime is a service that captures metrics from your editor about the code that you are working on.  For example, at this very moment, it is logging the time I spend editing this markdown file.  I'm currently using the free tier (a week of stats), but am thinking about paying for the service to track details longer.  You get a nice breakdown of the projects you work on (and can itegrate with GitHub), the types of files you edit (recently a lot of Ruby as I work more on Chef and Chef cookbooks again), the platforms you are working on, the time you spend editing those files, and the editors you are using.

## Better together

With RescueTime, I can see that I spent 3 hours in my editor and another hour in ConEmu (for example).  Wakatime then tells me that I was working on the `windows` cookbook, `powershell` cookbook, and the `kitchen-habitat` provisioner.  How, I can look back at the previous day (or days) and really see where a pet project ties up some time or a particular task really takes my day away.
