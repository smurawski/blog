title: Talking PowerShell on The Thirsty Developer

---

I recently had the opportunity to talk a bit about PowerShell with <a href="http://eraserandcrowbar.com/" target="_blank">Larry Clarkin</a> of <a href="http://thirstydeveloper.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">The Thirsty Developer</a> podcast.&#160; I had a great time talking with Larry and the time went very quickly (there is so much more I wanted to say, but we ran out of time).



The Thirsty Developer is a great podcast featuring <a href="http://eraserandcrowbar.com/" target="_blank">Larry Clarkin</a> and <a href="http://www.davebost.com/blog/" target="_blank">Dave Bost</a>, two Microsoft Evangelists in my area.&#160; They cover a number of development related topics and have touched on PowerShell in an <a href="http://thirstydeveloper.com/2008/12/02/TheThirstyDeveloper43DevelopingOnSharePoint.aspx" target="_blank">earlier show (#43)</a>.&#160; 



After I came across their show, I started to bug Larry about having more PowerShell content.&#160; I gave Larry a few names of possible interview candidates, but Larry and Dave primarily focus on in person interviews and feature a number of people in the local area.

Hopefully, Larry and Dave will have me back on in the future to dig in further!
