title: PowerShell, VMWare, and VESI in Wisconsin

---

On May 19th, <a href="http://www.vmguru.com/" target="_blank">Scott Herold</a> and I will be presenting for the Wisconsin VMWare Users Group. 
I'll be covering the basics of PowerShell, as well as an introduction to the VI Toolkit (for Windows)/PowerCLI.



Scott will be talking about  <a href="http://thevesi.org/index.jspa" target="_blank">the Virtualization EcoShell Initiative (VESI)</a>.



If you are in Wisconsin, the meeting details can be found <a href="http://campaign.vmware.com/usergroup/invites/Wisconsin_5-19-09.html" target="_blank">here</a>.



If you are not able to make the meeting, VMWare will be providing <a href="https://vmware.webex.com/vmware/j.php?ED=117340947&amp;UID=1109236007" target="_blank">a live stream of our presentations via WebEx</a>, as well as providing recordings after the fact.  



My presentation starts at 9 AM Central time and Scott follows me at about 9:50.
