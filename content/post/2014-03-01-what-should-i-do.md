title: What Should I Do?

---

I'm mulling over a couple of opportunities and I really don't know what's the better value. &nbsp;I'd really appreciate your input.


I'm debating on which conference to go to..


## Should I go to TechEd or DevOpsDays Pittsburgh?



At TechEd, I'd be able to use "hallway track" time to sell DevOps concepts and share my journey. &nbsp;I'd also be able to see a good number of friends there.


At DevOpsDays Pittsburgh, I'd be able to share the DevOps in a Windows environment story, but with a crowd that's mainly *nix focused and already sold on DevOps concepts (sort of preaching to the choir).


## I really could use your help in deciding where to go!
