title: Want the Latest ChefDK on Windows?

---

### Chocolatey?


`choco install chefdk`


### PowerShell PackageManagement (formerly OneGet)


`install-package chefdk`


### Don't have either of those?


Well, get on the ball and grab [WMF 5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46889), [Windows 10](https://insider.windows.com/), or [install Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)!


### OR


From our Omnitruck site, with a variant of the "curl | bash" install.


`iwr -usebasic https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.ps1 | iex; install chefdk`


### Can't do any of that?


Grab it from our [Downloads](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/windows/) page.
