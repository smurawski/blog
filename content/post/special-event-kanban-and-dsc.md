title: Special Event - Kanban and DSC

---

## First up - on December 9th and 10th



I'm working with [Jessica DeVita](https://twitter.com/ubergeekgirl), [Dominica DeGrandis](https://twitter.com/dominicad), and [J. Paul Reed](https://twitter.com/soberbuildeng) to help put on a [two day event in Los Angeles designed to help you level up your operations game](http://kanbandsc-devops.eventbrite.com/). &nbsp;


This is training that would normally run over a $1000 - and you can go for $100 - with all the proceeds going to [Girls Who Code](http://girlswhocode.com/), which is a national nonprofit working to close the gender gap in technology and engineering.
<h3 style="margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px"><span style="font-size:small">**<span>Description:</span>**</span>



<span style="font-size:small">Ask any Operations team what the boss complains about and you’ll likely hear, “Things take too long and there is no visibility as to why.”&nbsp; Come discover how to improve visibility on work and speed up the delivery pipeline. This 2-day workshop on Kanban and Declarative Configuration Management with DSC and Chef provides learning on two essential Devops aspects - culture and tools.</span>


### <span style="font-size:small">**<span>Who should attend:</span>**</span>



<span style="font-size:small">Beginners and anyone who wants to become more familiar with Kanban for IT Ops and implementing DSC.</span>

<span style="font-size:small">Come play the Kanban for Devops board game simulation.

### <span style="font-size:small">**Day 2 - Declarative Configuration Management for Windows server&nbsp; (9:30 - 5:00 pm) with Steven Murawski (@StevenMurawski)**&nbsp;</span>



<span style="font-size:small">Join Steven for a day long &nbsp;deep dive into declarative configuration management. &nbsp;We'll explore why declarative configuration management is such an important tool in today's IT environment. &nbsp;We'll examine the components of PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), which is the in-box configuration management engine shipping with Windows Server. &nbsp;And finally, we'll see how Chef can help you build on your DSC efforts to create an end-to-end pipeline for managing your infrastructure. (NOTE: If you want to follow along, bring a laptop with Windows Management Framework 4 or newer or that has a VM that has Windows Management Framework 4 or newer.)</span>


## And if that's not enough -&nbsp;on December 11th and 12th



I'll be leading a[ two day Chef Fundamentals class](https://www.getchef.com/blog/event/2-day-chef-fundamentals-windows-los-angeles-ca/) focused on managing Windows Server.&nbsp;


### So come out and join us - it'll be a great week!
