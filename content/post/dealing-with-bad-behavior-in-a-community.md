title: Dealing With Bad Behavior in a Community

---

It may come as no surprise, but I'm pretty active in a variety of technically focused communities. &nbsp; Most recently, I've become a Community Manager for Chef and joined the Board of Directors for LOPSA. &nbsp;I've been an active member of the PowerShell community for about as long as I've been in IT. &nbsp;I try to keep active in my local technical community.


There are a few things in these communities I've been silent on that continue to rear their ugly heads and if I don't address it, I'm just as guilty as those who perpetrated those action.


At Chef,[ I'm losing a co-worker](https://sethvargo.com/leaving-chef/) due to the inability of some people to self-edit and behave in a civilized manner. &nbsp;In LOPSA, we lose people due to a level of hostility (towards women, towards conservatives, towards Christians, towards Windows administrators) present in the IRC chat rooms. &nbsp;In the PowerShell community, we are fractured and cliquish (and lacking a good bit of diversity).


## Community is what binds us together



We seek out and become part of larger community to find a place we fit in, with people who have experiences or interests that mirror ours. &nbsp;Some of us stay quiet and lurk around the edges of the community, engaging only when we have to. &nbsp;Others are right out front, sharing their thoughts, opinions, and in the case of technical communities, code, scripts, projects, etc. &nbsp;Many are in the middle, we share occasionally and are quiet participants much of the time. &nbsp;


## There will be disagreements

<p dir="ltr">Because we've joined (explicitly or implicitly) a community around a particular subject, we are likely to have strong opinions about topics in that space. &nbsp;That is OK. &nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">We can debate these opinions and we can criticize opinions. &nbsp;That is OK as well.
<p dir="ltr">We can dislike people's personalities. &nbsp;That is natural and almost guaranteed in any community.
<p dir="ltr">But when the disagreements turn personal or we act on dislike of a person, that's where the line is crossed.
<h2 dir="ltr">So what? &nbsp;People argue all the time

<p dir="ltr">When attacks turn personal, it can encourage them to leave the community, or at least silence them. &nbsp;When the attacks turn physical or to threats of physical violence, we cross into the realm of criminal behavior. &nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">The diversity in opinions, approaches, and experiences is what gives a community its strength and potential. &nbsp;Efforts to minimize that threaten the existence and purpose of the community. &nbsp;It turns the community toxic.
<h2 dir="ltr">How can we encourage good behavior

<p dir="ltr">First, we can demand our communities have a code of conduct. &nbsp;At Chef, we have some [community guidelines](http://docs.getchef.com/community_guidelines.html). &nbsp;LOPSA has an [etiquette policy](http://governance.lopsa.org/LOPSA_Policies/Etiquette_Policy). &nbsp;PowerShell.org does not have one at this point in time, though after I post this, I'll be reaching out to them to formulate one. &nbsp;Having a code of conduct is a start. &nbsp;There also needs to be known consequences for violating those policies and a formal way to report violations (that is safe for reporters).
<p dir="ltr">Second, know how to report violations of that code of conduct. &nbsp;Even if you aren't directly impacted, you are impacted by the dilution of your community. &nbsp;**Every act that seeks to silence or minimize members of your community is a direct attack on YOU. **&nbsp;You join a community to enhance and improve your quality of life. &nbsp;Efforts to undermine that community are directly impactful to you. &nbsp;People external to your community see these things happen and become less likely to participate in your community.&nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">Third, model the good behavior. &nbsp;Don't engage in "joking" that belittles a person, gender, race, or operating system preference. &nbsp;Call out those that are, or if you don't feel comfortable doing that, use the reporting mechanism you identified as above. &nbsp;Or if you really don't feel comfortable, let me know, either via the[ contact form on my blog](http://stevenmurawski.com/contact/), a DM on twitter (@[stevenmurawski](http://twitter.com/stevenmurawski)), ping me on Skype (steven.murawski) or Google Hangouts (steven.murawski at gmail.com). &nbsp;I am happy to be your advocate. &nbsp;I want people to be welcome in my communities and I want those communities to be able to grow.
<p dir="ltr">Fourth, demand that your organization follow up on these incidents and release as much detail as they publicly can. &nbsp;Transparency (as much as legally possible) is a boon to the community.
<h2 dir="ltr">What are my communities doing?

<p dir="ltr">[Nathen Harvey](http://twitter.com/nathenharvey) (my boss) [just wrote about what we are doing at Chef](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2014/08/27/behaving-responsibly-in-the-chef-community/). &nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">I'm advocating for something similar at LOPSA and we are investigating ways to make our etiquette policy more visible and define what the punitive actions are. &nbsp;
<p dir="ltr">As I mentioned above, I'll be reaching out to PowerShell.org to get this on their radar as well.
<p dir="ltr">**What are you going to do in your communities?**
