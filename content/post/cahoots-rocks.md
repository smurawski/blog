title: Cahoots! Rocks

---

Cahoots! is an open source project that provides a Question and Answer forum that is driven by community participation.&#160; It also includes blogging, podcasting, and a knowledgebase functionality.&#160; 



Logins are managed via OpenID, so you don’t have to worry about managing additional login credentials.



Your capabilities to create content are driven by “esteem”, which is a metric for tracking the response to content you provide.&#160; You can gain “esteem” by asking asking questions, posting blog entries, and having people follow your activities on the site.&#160; For more details on that, check out the <a href="http://test.concentratedtech.com/about" target="_blank">about page</a>.
