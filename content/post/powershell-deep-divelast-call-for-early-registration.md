[The first ever PowerShell Deep Dive conference is coming up in April (18-19).](https://register.crgevents.com/TEC2011/Register/Login/UsernamePassword/Default.aspx)&#160; I'm thrilled to be going.&#160; Early registration for the conference ends on 2/28 (just a day away), so save yourself $150 and register today!
