title: It's Too Hard...

---

# Learning XYZ technology is Too Hard...



How many times have we heard that from our friends and/or co-workers?&nbsp; How many times have we uttered it ourselves?


As sysadmins, we do hard stuff all the time.


*   Networking is hard.
*   Clustering services is hard.
*   Directory services are hard.
*   Writing scripts is hard.

And on and on.


# Get Over It



We learn and do hard things all the time.&nbsp; They get easier each time we do them, especially if we do them often.


Go forth and learn something difficult.&nbsp; This week I'm going to learn <a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go.</a>


**What will you learn?**
