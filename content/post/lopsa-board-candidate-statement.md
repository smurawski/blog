title: LOPSA Board - Candidate Statement

---

# First a bit of background



I'm Steve Murawski (in case you couldn't tell from the URL ;) ). &nbsp;I'm running for one of the open seats on the [LOPSA Board](https://lopsa.org/board). &nbsp;If you haven't heard of LOPSA, stay tuned - more on that in a minute. &nbsp;


I've led a circuitous route to becoming a sysadmin, but when I first became a sysadmin, LOPSA was there. &nbsp;LOPSA (and the Madison, Wisconsin chapter) were my first human introduction to sysadmins outside the handful that worked in capacities similar to mine.


I learned a bit more about LOPSA's goals in those first years as a sysadmin, but honestly the biggest benefit to me was the discount on O'Reilly books (and even that had a hard time competing with Amazon's regular pricing).


With the prodding of [Matt Simmons](http://www.standalone-sysadmin.com/blog/), I began to get involved with LOPSA-East (PICC at the time) and Cascadia as an instructor, bringing some of my Windows experience to the training program. &nbsp;Teaching at those conferences has been a very rewarding experience and I love the community of attendees.


## So what is LOPSA?

<p dir="ltr">Many of the readers of my blog might be unfamiliar with [LOPSA](https://lopsa.org/), so here's the short version - LOPSA is The League of Professional Systems Administrators, a professional organization dedicated to raising the art and science of systems administration. &nbsp;There are a number of local LOPSA chapters and affiliates, and two affiliated regional conferences ([LOPSA-East ](http://lopsa-east.org/)and the [Cascadia IT Conference](http://casitconf.org/)). &nbsp;LOPSA affiliated trainers also engage with several other conferences. LOPSA members enjoy several discounts, as well as access to professional and liability insurance.


# So why should I be on the board?



I'm not so sure I should be. &nbsp;I was asked to run and thought about it for quite some time. &nbsp;It'd be a lot easier to just go on with the teaching circuit and reap the benefits of a community that I tangentially participate in. &nbsp;


LOPSA professes to&nbsp;


*   advance the practice of systems administration
*   support, recognize, educate, and encourage its practitioners
*   serve the public through education and outreach on systems administration issues

I can't promise to change the world or launch LOPSA to the forefront of the sysadmin community, but I do promise to approach each challenge the board is faced with through the lens of the key goals of LOPSA expressed above. &nbsp;


## A few key thoughts



First, I'd like to raise awareness of LOPSA in the traditional Microsoft community. &nbsp;A number of the conferences and user groups I attend and speak at have never heard of LOPSA. &nbsp;Outside the mentoring program, I've had a hard time delivering a convincing case for membership.&nbsp;


Second, if LOPSA is positioned as the organization representing systems administrators, where was the content representing our take on Heartbleed? &nbsp;That was a bit of a news story, but outside a few member blogs, was there an official LOPSA statement?

If elected to the board, I'd like to see LOPSA, as an organization, take a position on newsworthy events and reach out to the media to share our position.


## If you like my thoughts

<p dir="ltr">and are a LOPSA member, I'd encourage you to consider voting for me for the LOPSA Board of Directors in the coming election.
