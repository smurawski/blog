title: What SysAdmins Think When They Hear &quot;DevOps&quot;

---

They hear:


*   Devs getting root or administrator rights on production machines.
*   No control over application deployment.
*   Moving to "the cloud".
*   "Shoot from the hip" administration - where things are always changing.
*   Configuration management tooling.
*   Automate all the things!

 


What they should be hearing:


*   Getting to know your developers and other business folk.
*   Understanding the whole system, not just your little corner of the world.
*   Sharing ideas internally and externally.
*   Automate the pain in the whole system. &nbsp;
*   Change process to improve the flow from the business out to the customer.

 


DevOps has become quite a loaded term, filled with strong feelings on a number of sides. &nbsp; When you hear "DevOps", take a breath read [this post](http://stevenmurawski.com/powershell/2013/4/devops-is-going-to-make-my-head-explode) or [this one](http://www.getchef.com/blog/2010/07/16/what-devops-means-to-me/)&nbsp;or[ this one](http://tech.mangot.com/blog/2013/05/29/-im-not-a-devops-dot-dot-dot-are-you-an-agile/).&nbsp;
