title: PowerShell at PICC

---

I had a great time with my classes at [PICC](http://www.picconf.org/).&#160; Both the PowerShell Fundamentals class and the PowerShell Tips and Tricks class were a lot of fun and resulted in great conversations at the breaks and after the classes.



The fun continued in the evening with the Bird of a Feather sessions where we spent some time talking about Server 2012, Server Core, and remote server management.&#160; What a great time.



I’ve uploaded my slides and sample scripts and I’ll have the shell histories from the classes posted in a day or two (I need to comment them so they are useable…), so check back on Monday for the annotated shell histories.

I wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who attended my class and especially those who made a point of talking to me about problems they face or where they are using PowerShell.



I also wanted to thank the organizers of PICC for having me out again this year.
