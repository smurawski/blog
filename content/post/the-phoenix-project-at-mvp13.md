title: 'The Phoenix Project At #MVP13'

---

The Microsoft MVP Summit is coming up again (yes, that's twice this year) and I'm getting prepped to head out to Bellevue.


For this trip, I've got a "special offer". &nbsp;I'll be giving away 100 copies of "[The Phoenix Project](http://itrevolution.com/books/phoenix-project-devops-book/)", thanks to [Kevin Behr](https://twitter.com/kevinbehr), [Gene Kim](https://twitter.com/realgenekim), and [George Spafford](https://twitter.com/gspaff) (the authors of the book).


## What is "The Phoenix Project"?



Well, a book review deserves a post of its own (and will get it at some point), but the TL;DR; version is "The Phoenix Project" chronicles the story of Bill, an IT Operations manager in an enterprise setting, as enters into an unwilling journey to finding the principals of DevOps. &nbsp;The book is fictional, but everyone whose been&nbsp;in our field for almost any length of time will identify with the themes and scenarios.


## How do I get one?



I'd like to try a couple of things... &nbsp;I'm getting the books Monday afternoon, so on Tuesday and Wednesday I'll be giving them away actively. &nbsp;On Tuesday and Wednesday,&nbsp;I'll give away 15-20 copies in the morning and 15-20 copies after lunch. &nbsp;That'll leave a few copies for random intervals.&nbsp;


To get your copy, you'll have to find me (on Twitter I'm [@stevenmurawski](http://twitter.com/stevenmurawski)&nbsp;and I'll try to keep updated as to where I'm at while I'm giving them away). &nbsp;


When you find me, I'll ask you one question - **"What does DevOps mean to you?"**


After that, if I have a&nbsp;copy of the book left to hand out, it's yours!


### What if I don't see you or don't see you until after you are out of books?



Don't fret, there is a good chance we can figure something out. &nbsp;If we talk in person, I'll give you more detail at that time. &nbsp;I'll follow up this post after the Summit if there is a lot of outstanding interest.
