title: Deep Thoughts by Tom Limoncelli

---

My co-worker (and sysadmin-crush) [Tom Limoncelli](http://everythingsysadmin) (@yesthattom) has been killing it lately with blog posts around automation and skills required for elevating systems administration and operations from just firefighting and keeping the lights on.&nbsp;


If you don't subscribe to [his blog](http://everythingsysadmin.com/), you should. &nbsp;Do it now.. I'll wait.


A few of his recent posts (as well as some older ones) have been on my mind as well. &nbsp;I'm sure I'll share my take in the near future, but for now read Tom's posts and take them to heart.
