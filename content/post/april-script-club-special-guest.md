title: April Script Club – Special Guest

---

The <a href="http://powershellgroup.org/milwaukee.wi" target="_blank">Greater Milwaukee Script Club</a> <a href="http://mkescriptclub.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">will be meeting on April 20th</a> and we will have a special guest – James Brundage (<a href="http://twitter.com/jamesbru" target="_blank">twitter</a> | <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/MediaAndMicrocode/" target="_blank">blog</a> | <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/" target="_blank">blog</a>).&#160; James is a member of the PowerShell team at Microsoft, as well as a blogger, community member, guest on the <a href="http://powerscripting.net/" target="_blank">PowerScripting Podcast</a>, and author of the <a href="http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/PowerShellPack" target="_blank">PowerShellPack</a> – part of the Windows Resource Kit.



Last month, we used the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/01/01/the-admin-development-model-and-send-snippet.aspx" target="_blank">Admin Development Model</a> to solve a particular problem <a href="http://www.liquidclever.com/" target="_blank">one of our brave volunteers</a> was trying to deal with in his environment. 



We have planned to talk a bit about error handling, and as always, work on **your** scripts.



If you are a PowerShell user or need to become a PowerShell user and are in southeastern Wisconsin, come on down, all are welcome (<a href="http://mkescriptclub.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">free registration requested</a>)!
