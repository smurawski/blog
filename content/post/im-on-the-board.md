title: I'm on the Board!

---

While I didn't win a seat on the LOPSA Board of Directors, there was a vacancy due to a resignation of an existing board member and I was asked to fill that position.&nbsp;


## What does this mean for me? &nbsp;



I'll be learning more about the operational and strategic efforts of [LOPSA](https://lopsa.org).


You'll be hearing more about LOPSA and what LOPSA is doing from me here and on [Ops All The Things](http://www.opsallthethings.com). &nbsp;(Anything I can share, I will.)


Most importantly though, I want you feedback on how LOPSA can help make your career field more awesome. (Yes, I stole that from Chef and Jesse Robbins.)
