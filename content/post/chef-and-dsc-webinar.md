title: Chef and DSC - The Webinar

---

Earlier today, I did a webinar on Chef and DSC, which was pretty well attended.  In about a week, we'll have a follow up post on the Chef blog with answers to the questions I did not get to.

A big thank you to everyone who showed up - you have showed that there is great interest in using Chef and DSC together!
