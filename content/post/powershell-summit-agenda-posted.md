title: PowerShell Summit Agenda Posted

And I'll be there!


I have three sessions:


*   The Live and Times of a DSC Resource
*   Building Scalable Configurations
*   Patterns for Implementing Configuration with a DSC Pull Server

[There are a number of other great sessions lined up over three tracks (Practical, Domain, and Developer).](http://powershell.org/wp/community-events/summit/powershell-summit-north-america/summit-agenda/)&nbsp;I don't know what to attend when I'm not speaking.. there are so many great options. &nbsp;


I think there are still spots available for the Summit, so register soon!
