You think <a href="http://powerscripting.net" target="_blank">Hal and Jonathan would learn</a>, but they keep having me back on the show.



Hal was out of town, but <a href="http://powerscripting.wordpress.com/2012/05/14/episode-185-steven-murawski-on-v3-and-jeffrey-snovers-keynote-from-the-2012-powershell-deep-dive/" target="_blank">Jon and I had a great talk about Server 2012 and PowerShell V3</a>.&#160; As always, there was great conversation in the chat room and some good questions.&#160; Jon had a surprise for us all.&#160; After the interview, he played Jeffrey Snoverâ€™s keynote from the PowerShell Deep Dive.&#160; 



Check out this episode and the other great shows and interviews they have.
