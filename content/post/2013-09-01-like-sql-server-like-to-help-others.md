<a href="https://twitter.com/Kendra_Little" target="_blank">Kendra Little</a> <a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2013/09/missed-connection-employer-seeking-employee" target="_blank">just posted that Brent Ozar Unlimited is looking for their next employee</a>.


I've known <a href="https://twitter.com/BrentO" target="_blank">Brent</a> for a few years now, and have recently met (over the past year and a half or so) <a href="https://twitter.com/grrl_geek" target="_blank">Jes </a>and most recently Kendra. &nbsp;They are an exciting, smart group of people who are passionate about learning and sharing (some of the key cultural components of DevOps - even if they are DBA's). &nbsp;If I didn't have <a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2012/12/03/welcome-serverfault-valued-associate-0000005/" target="_blank">one of the best jobs in the world already</a>, I'd love to go work with them.


Don't walk, run over to &nbsp;<a href="http://www.brentozar.com/archive/2013/09/missed-connection-employer-seeking-employee" target="_blank">Kendra's post</a>&nbsp;and take a look at the awesome benefits, the company culture, and what they are looking for in a co-worker (I'll give you a hint.. learning and sharing are key components).
