title: Wisconsin Virtual SQL Server Lunch and Learn

---

I just finished taking up 13 people’s lunch hour to talk a bit about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714418(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank">PowerShell</a> V2, SQL Server, and the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/powershell/archive/2007/01/01/the-admin-development-model-and-send-snippet.aspx" target="_blank">admin development model</a>.



I want to thank <a href="http://wisconsin.sqlpass.org/" target="_blank">John Allman and the Wisconsin SQL Server User Group</a> for allowing me the time to share a bit about PowerShell.&#160; I believe John will be posting the recording for those who are interested.



<a href="http://download.usepowershell.com/PowerShellV2.pptx" target="_blank">My slide deck is available here.</a>&#160; The slides aren’t worth much, but the resources on the last two are where the real meat is.
