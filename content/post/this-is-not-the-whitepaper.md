We (the tech industry) have been enablers for IT leadership to focus on "doing just good enough".  The ongoing search for whitepapers and best practice are efforts to insulate themselves from blame and risk of going the wrong path.  

## IT has changed

This may have made some sense when initiatives would take 3 to 5 years to be delivered (or longer).  But that is not the IT operating environment of today and more importantly, tomorrow.  

Vendors have been on a mad rush to supply case studies, white papers, and all the collateral an IT leader would need to feel secure in committing to a firm direction for a longer period of time.  Now, we are trying to convince folks not to tie into long term projects outside of one real long term process - that of continuous improvement and digital transformation.

In the days of yore, you could start a case study with a customer on an early release and follow that through release of a product and you knew that it would be 3 to 5 years before a new version would follow and probably 10 years before the customer would move off of their chosen platform.  

Today, customers have to look at a widely shifting array of products and projects and to adopt (and maybe discard them) at a dazzling rate.  The case study they are looking for is not the case study they need.  They want assurance that the platform (specific tech not just Azure in general) they adopt will be a "safe" choice.  The safety though comes from agility and having control over your process.

## Hipster IT - I was doing ITIL Ironically

The search for the case study or whitepaper is literally asking "How can I use yesterday's practices today?" or "Can you develop the path with my competitor for me to copy later?".  

IT leadership needs to step up and realize that they are not special snowflakes who reign over a mystical realm that is not understood by the rest of the business.  The  patterns and practices that guide other facets of business apply - things like Lean and Theory of Constraints are there to provide a framework for developing a pattern of operation to experiment and use experimentation, feedback, and agility to reduce risk.


## Time to Step Up

And, as more and more services crop up, their reliance on internal technical teams becomes much more tenuous.  If IT leadership wants to stay relevant in their business, they have to stop looking for the elusive whitepaper that will help defend their solution for the next 3 to 5 year capital project and refocus on what IT is actually helping the business accomplish.
