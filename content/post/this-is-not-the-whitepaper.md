We (the tech industry) have been enablers for IT leadership to focus on "doing just good enough".  The ongoing search for whitepapers and best practice are efforts to insulate themselves from blame and risk of going the wrong path.  

## IT has changed

This may have made some sense when initiatives would take 3 to 5 years to be delivered (or longer).  But that is not the IT operating environment of today and more importantly, tomorrow.  

Vendors have been on a mad rush to supply case studies, white papers, and all the collateral an IT leader would need to feel secure in committing to a firm direction for a longer period of time.  Now, we are trying to convince folks not to tie into long term projects outside of one real long term process - that of continuous improvement and digital transformation.

In the days of yore, you could start a case study with a customer on an early release and follow that through release of a product and you knew that it would be 3 to 5 years before a new version would follow and probably 10 years before the customer would move off of their chosen platform.  

Today, customers have to look at a widely shifting array of products and projects and to adopt (and maybe discard them) at a dazzling rate.  The case study they are looking for is not the case study they need.  They want assurance that the platform (specific tech not just Azure in general) they adopt will be a "safe" choice.  The safety though comes from agility and having control over your process.


## Hipster IT - I was doing ITIL Ironically

The search for the case study or whitepaper is literally asking "How can I use yesterday's practices today?" or "Can you develop the path with my competitor for me to copy later?".  

IT leadership needs to step up and realize that they are not special snowflakes who reign over a mystical realm that is not understood by the rest of the business.  The  patterns and practices that guide other facets of business apply - things like Lean and Theory of Constraints are there to provide a framework for developing a pattern of operation to experiment and use experimentation, feedback, and agility to reduce risk.


## Time to Step Up

And, as more and more services crop up, their reliance on internal technical teams becomes much more tenuous.  If IT leadership wants to stay relevant in their business, they have to stop looking for the elusive whitepaper that will help defend their solution for the next 3 to 5 year capital project and refocus on what IT is actually helping the business accomplish.

## So What Is The Role of Services or Contractors?

Service providers or contractors are either going to be handling things that are core to your business or things that are either low impact or utilities.  How we approach evaluating these things depends on their impact on the flow of work through the organization.

For example, email is a necessity in most companies, but for the most part can be treated as a utility.  There are a multitude of offerings around email and office software from a number of vendors.  There is a lot of material out to do comparisions.  Migrating between services is not trivial, but it is possible.  So, in most cases, email would be a common service that you'd subscribe to a service.

Now, when you have something that is more critical to your core offering, maybe your public facing website.  If you decide to contract that out, you'll need to make sure that the terms of your contract match the goals of your organization.  If being able to quickly change the behavior of the site is important, that capability needs to be accounted for in the service agreement.  This may mean a fuzzier, longer term arrangement than a fixed bid type scenario, but this reflects the pattern of work in today's environment.  I wouldn't trust a fixed bid for something that I expect to be responsive to my changing needs over a period of time.

When we look at scenarios like this, we are used to focusing on the cost side of things.  This can hamper our ability to see other alteratives, like tying some of the compensation to how the provided service improves things for the business (whether that's an increase in sales or improvement in effectiveness or whatever the success metric is).  The definition of done has to tie to achieving the objectives or at least moving things in the direction of objective.  When the deliverable is a set of fixed items, the vendor has no incentive to help if the business drivers do not respond to the impact of the project.

Addiitonally, for these type of projects, we tend to scope things way to broadly.  Just like internal efforts, moving to working in small batches and allowing the effect of those changes to help guide the direction for next steps is critical.  Working in smaller batches with a vendor also reduces the complexity of determining the best way to align longer term goals.
