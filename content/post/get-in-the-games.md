title: Get in the Games!

---

This year’s <a href="http://bit.ly/2011sgall" target="_blank">Scripting Games</a> is well underway, but there is still time to get involved.



You can submit entries for 7 days after an event was released, so there is still time to participate.&#160; 



## Definitely Fun, Not all Games…




If you think that the games are just that, think again.&#160; If you are just getting in to PowerShell, the events cover many practical applications.

## There is Still Time




Get off your feet and sit back down at the keyboard.&#160; **These skills are important** and will only grow more so with coming versions of Microsoft server applications and releases of Windows.
