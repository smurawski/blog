title: WI VMUG Presentation with Scott Herold

---

This morning, <a href="http://vmguru.com/" target="_blank">Scott Herold</a> and I did back to back presentations on PowerShell and the <a href="http://thevesi.org/index.jspa" target="_blank">Virtualization EcoShell</a> for the <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/community/vmug/us-central/wisconsin" target="_blank">Wisconsin VMWare Users Group</a>.
Time flew by and I didn’t get to the second half of my slide deck, [so if you are interested, here it is](http://static.squarespace.com/static/50a13c5be4b039333cb95a3b/50acf4c0e4b0c945709cfb5c/50acf4c1e4b0c945709cfb79/1242692989000/?format=original).



If you want to see the webcast, <a href="https://vmware.webex.com/vmware/lsr.php?AT=pb&amp;SP=MC&amp;rID=32782887&amp;rKey=1857E078AB591227" target="_blank">you can find it here</a>.  Just a word of warning, I haven’t listened to it yet, but we were recording over Skype and a fixed microphone while speaking over another mic in a larger room.  I’m guessing the sound quality is not the best, but should be understandable.



Thanks to Scott Herold for sharing the “stage” with me and thanks to Rod Gabriel and the WI VMUG for allowing me to share a bit about PowerShell.
