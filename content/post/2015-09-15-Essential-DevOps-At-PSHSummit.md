title: 'Essential DevOps At the #PSHSummit'

## Kicking off the PowerShell Summit EU

Yesterday morning, I held one of the starting sessions for the PowerShell Summit EU - entitled Essential Skills for a DevOps World and we had a great conversation as we walked through the concepts that help enable consistent flow (the first way), feedback (the second way), and velocity (the third way).

You can find my deck {{% link "talks/pshsummit-essential-devops.html" %}}here{{% /link %}} and I'll add the video link once it is posted.

I also mentioned a [DevOps reading list]({{< relref "devops-reading-list.md" >}}) to get you started.
