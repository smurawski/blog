title: Keep It Short

---

PowerShell is much more readable (and understandable when variables and functions are well named and the scriptblocks are kept short. &nbsp;


If I have to scroll and scroll and scroll to read one script/function, it's much harder to follow. &nbsp;


It's also easier to track down logic errors or a lack of error handling, since you are dealing with much smaller pieces of code.


For example:

 
   <script src="https://gist.github.com/smurawski/d8df458c13f7db87e4e8.js"></script>
 


<br>


vs.

 
   <script src="https://gist.github.com/smurawski/c7e72c71d60826cd7b29.js"></script>
 


<br>


**Which would you rather read?**


If you'd like to see the "full" set of functions, [take a look at this Gist](https://gist.github.com/smurawski/6de63da2c9af6f4cf595).
