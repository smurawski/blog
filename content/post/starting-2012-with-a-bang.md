title: Starting 2012 with a Bang

---

I’m so excited for 2012, personally and professionally.&#160; I started the year with a great honor, I was awarded a <a href="https://mvp.support.microsoft.com/profile/Steven.Murawski" target="_blank">Microsoft MVP award for PowerShell</a>.



### Just a bit of background…&#160; 




I started in IT in 2006 as the IT guy for a municipal police department.&#160; It was the first such full time position the department had.&#160; I immediately became responsible for a public safety network that needed to be operational 24/7.&#160; This required me to deal with a lot of intermittent issues or requests and I quickly saw that I needed some tools to get my job done well. 



I looked around and found out that the *NIX guys had it pretty well covered with shell scripting, Perl, Python, TCL, sed, awk, etc..&#160; I went looking for the Microsoft equivalent.&#160; I found Python and started doing some scripting with that.&#160; I loved the syntax and structure, as well as the availability of an interactive interpreter.&#160; The biggest pain was in dealing with the COM layer interactions.&#160; I explored C# and began to dabble with that as well.



And then I found PowerShell.&#160; I’ve been a PowerShell fanatic since the day I discovered it.&#160; It was a shell language.&#160; It had a scripting capability.&#160; I could extend it with .NET and C#.&#160; It worked with WMI and COM in a much more interactive manner and I didn’t have to go through some of the hoops that I had to with Python.&#160; It was also a Microsoft product (and eventually was available through Windows Update or with newer OSes in the box), which made it easier to deploy (policy-wise and distribution-wise).



Since that point in early 2006, I have been pushing PowerShell to help in all of the varied environments I’ve found myself in.&#160; I’ve become a speaker and a trainer and love sharing the capabilities of PowerShell and seeing others find value and make their work easier (or even possible).



### This wouldn’t have been possible without…




I never would have been awarded this without the ceaseless lobbying of <a href="http://dougfinke.com/blog/" target="_blank">Doug Finke</a> and the great interactions I’ve had with various members of the PowerShell team.&#160; I know a number of other PowerShell MVPs also were vocal in nominating me (forgive me if I forgot anyone), including <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/ScriptFanatic/" target="_blank">Shay Levy</a>, <a href="http://marcoshaw.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Marco Shaw</a>, <a href="http://powershellers.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Aleksandar Nikolic</a>, and <a href="http://www.ravichaganti.com/" target="_blank">Ravikanth Chaganti.</a>&#160; I also had some great support from some of the Clustering MVPs (like Mike Steineke) and team (thanks Rob).&#160; Last, but not least, I’ve had great support from my local DPE team.&#160; Our local Developer Evangelist, <a href="http://csell.net/" target="_blank">Clark Sell</a>, has never stopped encouraging me in spreading my thoughts on PowerShell and the development of a unified management API to .NET developer groups in our region (and further via his <a href="http://developersmackdown.com/" target="_blank">podcast</a>).&#160; Our local IT Pro Evangelist, <a href="http://mythoughtsonit.com/" target="_blank">Brian Lewis</a>, has been a stalwart supporter of both user groups we have going in the Milwaukee area, the <a href="http://mkescriptclub.eventbrite.com" target="_blank">Greater Milwaukee Script Club</a> and the <a href="http://gmitpuc.com" target="_blank">Greater Milwaukee IT Pro User Community</a>.



### Finally,




I want to thank you, the readers of my blog, the attendees of my script club or IT Pro user group, and any of the various attendees of talks I have given.&#160; Thank you for allowing me to share a bit of my experience and thoughts with you and I can’t wait to see where this year goes (PowerShell V3 is on the horizon!!!).
