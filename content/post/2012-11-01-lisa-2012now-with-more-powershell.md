The 2012 LISA (Large Installation System Administration) Conference is coming up (December 9-14).



If you aren’t familiar with LISA, it is a conference focusing on systems administration topics with a rich history (this is the 26th one).&#160; There are 47 different full or half-day classes to choose from, as well as three days of additional technical sessions across three main themes – Cloud Computing, Super Sysadmin, and IPv6 and DNSSEC.



You’ll find sessions like “Seven Habits of the Highly Effective System Administrator”, “Root Cause Analysis”, “Building a Massively Scalable, Geographically Disparate IaaS Cloud”, “Dude, Where’s My Data?&#160; Replicating and Migrating Data Across Data Centers and Clouds”, “Using and Migrating to IPv6”, and “If You Can’t Monitor It You Can’t Manage It” and tons more ( <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12/training-program/training-program" target="_blank">more about the training program</a> and <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa12/tech-schedule/technical-sessions" target="_blank">more about the technical sessions</a>).



I’ll be at LISA this year (my first time there) teaching a half day PowerShell Fundamentals class.&#160; I’m really excited to be going there, as I’ve been hearing rave reviews about this conference for the past three years.



I hope to see you there!
