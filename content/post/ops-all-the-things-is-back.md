title: Ops All The Things Is BACK!

---

We had a bit of a lag in getting out shows (mainly blocked on my dread of audio editing).


The fine folks at Chef ([site](http://www.getchef.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com/chef)) have offered to sponsor the podcast and we now have an AWESOME editor - Mandy Moore ([The Ruby Rep](https://twitter.com/therubyrep)) and she turns around well edited shows in no time flat.


Look forward to more consistent shows from Chris ([cwebber](https://twitter.com/cwebber)) and myself!
