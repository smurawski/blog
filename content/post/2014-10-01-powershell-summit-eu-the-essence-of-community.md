title: PowerShell Summit EU - The Essence of Community

---

I'm sitting on a plane heading to Seattle on my way back from the PowerShell Summit EU (on my way to the Chef Summit in Seattle).


I can only say that I was completely blown away by the attendees of the conference. &nbsp;This conference drew people from all over Europe (and a handful of folks from North America). &nbsp;


I have been led to expect European audiences to be less willing to engage speakers with questions/comments. &nbsp;One of the things that really makes the PowerShell Summit concept work is when the attendees ask questions and help drive the discussion. &nbsp;It keeps us as presenters honest and makes sure we cover things that are valuable to the attendees. &nbsp;I was pleasantly surprised to find the attendees of this event were more than willing to engage the speakers and it made for some great sessions.


The other misconception I had was that it was hard to break people out of their cultural groups. &nbsp;The DSC Hackathon on Monday night proved that wrong. &nbsp;There were four or five workspaces with different tasks at each station. &nbsp;People formed groups regardless of native language or country of origin. &nbsp;We were all PowerShell hackers, their to learn and experiment.


The final thing I want to note about my experience there was also in relation to the Hackathon. &nbsp;Very few people in attendance have every done anything with Desired State Configuration. &nbsp;For many, my 45 minute talk earlier in the day was the most time they had spent learning about it. &nbsp;Despite this, almost everyone came out for the Hackathon and dove right into the challenge. &nbsp;And, almost more importantly, we ended up with a handful of DSC resources (or at least good starts) that I'll be reviewing and adding to the community repository. &nbsp;To tackle a new technology and then be willing to publicly share that code takes a lot of guts.


I'm proud to have been a part of this event and even prouder of my community.
