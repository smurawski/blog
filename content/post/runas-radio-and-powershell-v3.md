title: RunAs Radio and PowerShell V3

---

I joined Richard Campbell, the host of <a href="http://runasradio.com" target="_blank">Runas Radio</a> to talk about <a href="http://runasradio.com/default.aspx?showNum=265" target="_blank">PowerShell V3 and Server 2012</a>.&#160; We had a great conversation and covered some of the improvements and new features in PowerShell V3 and the new cmdlets and support in Server 2012.



### What’s <a href="http://runasradio.com" target="_blank">RunAs Radio</a>?




<a href="http://runasradio.com" target="_blank">RunAs Radio</a> is a weekly internet audio talk show for IT professionals focused on Microsoft products.&#160; They cover a full range of topics from a Microsoft-centric view point.&#160; Each show is about 30 minutes long and is focused on a single topic.



### Why Should I Subscribe to the Show?




<a href="http://runasradio.com" target="_blank">RunAs Radio</a> provides a great way to keep on top what’s new and changing in systems administration.&#160; They cover topics from SQL Server to IPv6 to System Center to Group Policy to Wireshark and everything in between and in the cloud.&#160; Some of my favorite shows are with some of the Microsoft PFE's like Clint Huffman and Jeff Stokes, where they cover some performance monitoring and tuning topics.&#160; Even if you don’t work directly with a technology that they discuss, listening will provide you with a basic understanding or familiarity with other things happening in our industry.&#160; In this market, we never know where our jobs or careers are going to take us, so you never know when this information will pay off!
