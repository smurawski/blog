title: LOPSA-East is This Week

---

If you within travel distance to New Brunswick, NJ, there is a <a href="http://lopsa-east.org/2013/" target="_blank">great conference (LOPSA-East)&nbsp;</a>occurring&nbsp;on Friday May 3 and Saturday May 4th.


Keynoting the conference will be Marcus Ranum, one of pioneers in the firewall, VPN, and IDS systems.


LOPSA-East features technology specific training covering:


*   PowerShell
*   Windows Clustering
*   Puppet
*   Chef
*   CFEngine
*   IPV6 and DNSSEC
*   Working with SSDs



If you are trying to drive technical change (introducing configuration management in your environment for example), check out <a href="http://everythingsysadmin.com/" target="_blank">Tom Limoncelli</a>'s Evil Genius 101 class. &nbsp;Tom is the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-System-Network-Administration-Edition/dp/0321492668" target="_blank">The Practice of System and Network Administration</a>, which is THE book that helped me really become a sysadmin. &nbsp;Tom also has a class on Advanced Time Management focusing on team&nbsp;efficiency.


David Blank-Edelman will be talking about Building A SysAdmin sandbox. &nbsp;I've been bumping into David at a few conferences and I finally had the chance to hear his keynote at the Cascadia IT Conference this year which was entertaining and thought provoking. &nbsp;David also has a class on implementing Wordpress for SysAdmin&nbsp;


And, I would be remiss if I didn't highlight my co-worker <a href="http://meta.stackoverflow.com/users/170555/peter-grace" target="_blank">Peter Grace</a>'s class on the Care and Feeding of Windows Servers for Unix/Linux Admins. &nbsp;One thing that's come out of my classes has been a request for more transitional training. &nbsp;I've had a number of sysadmins who have primarily been in the Unix/Linux world and are now being required to deal with Windows systems as well. &nbsp;Pete lived that experience, and shares his thoughts on what you need to understand, troubleshoot, and maintain Windows servers in a way that is familiar for Unix/Linux admins.
