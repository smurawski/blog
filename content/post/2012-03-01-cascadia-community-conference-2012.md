title: Cascadia Community Conference - 2012

---

I had a great time at the <a href="http://www.casitconf.org/casitconf12/" target="_blank">Cascadia conference</a> this past weekend.&#160; I missed Friday, but got to spend all day Saturday teaching PowerShell to a great group of attendees.&#160; There were some great questions and interesting thoughts developed in both the Fundamentals class and the Tips and Tricks class.



I want to thank the organizers of the conference for having me out and especially to the attendees for my classes, most of whom spent all day with me. 



<a href="http://download.usepowershell.com/cascadia2012.zip" target="_blank">For those that were in the class, I've linked to a zip file with some of the commands we ran through, and an xml file with the shell history for the problem we worked through in the afternoon.</a>



To load the shell history, you can use Import-Clixml (path to the xml file) | add-history.&#160; After that Get-history will have all the commands we ran when we tried to work out the error handling for that web request.
