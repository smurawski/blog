title: Greater Milwaukee Script Club – Take 2

---

We had a pretty good turnout for the first Greater Milwaukee Script Club and a lot of interest in keeping it going, so I’ve set up a <a href="http://powershellgroup.org/milwaukee.wi" target="_blank">home page for the group</a> on <a href="http://huddledmasses.org" target="_blank">Joel “Jaykul” Bennet’s</a> PowerShellGroup.Org site, which serves as a portal page for PowerShell user groups.



Rod Gabriel (who heads up our local VMWare User Group) <a href="http://www.wivmug.org/2010/01/my-first-scripting-club-meeting/" target="_blank">has an excellent review of the event.</a>&#160; He covers why he considered attending (including why learning PowerShell was becoming a priority for him), as well as the event itself.



Registration is available for our next meeting – which will be February 16th at 6:00 PM at the Greenfield Municipal Court (<a href="http://mkescriptclub.eventbrite.com/" target="_blank">details here</a>).
