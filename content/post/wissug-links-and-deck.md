title: WISSUG Links and Deck

---

Thanks to the Wisconsin SQL Server Users Group for having me out last night. &nbsp;I had a great time talking about SQL Server and PowerShell.


All the links I referenced are available from [this bundle](http://bitly.com/bundles/stevenmurawski/2)&nbsp;and my slide deck is here.
