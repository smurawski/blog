#### What is a Script Club?




<a href="http://get-powershell.com/2009/04/04/powershell-script-club-in-seattle/" target="_blank">Andy Schneider describes a script club:</a>

Script Clubs are like a hands on lab with no set topic or teacher. You bring an idea for a script, and ask your fellow PowerShell users for help getting the script written.






This is not a lecture or presentation based group (though we may have presentations from time to time).&#160; Script Club is focused on creating working scripts that will help you get your work done or just enjoy yourself.
